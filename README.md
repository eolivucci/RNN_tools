Repository that collects various tools for autoregressive sampling and evaluation using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for many body systems/mathematical problems.

Sampling and evaluation of homogeneous monomials in M variables (x_1,...x_M) and degree deg.
It is structured as the sampling of configurations of a system of M distinguishable bosons with harmonic (integer) excitations from ground state (E_i=0) to the maximal excitation (E_i= deg).
The total energy of the system is fixed to be E_1+E_2+...E_M = deg. The purpose of this RNN is to sample and evaluate monomials in order to obtain specific classes of polynomials (e.g. symmetric) with VMC.
